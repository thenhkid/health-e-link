                <h4>Evolving Health Information Exchange Landscape</h4>
                <p>
                    National, state, regional and local HIE initiatives have promoted clinical data sharing models and the potential of interoperable health information systems for many years. However, 
                    there has been limited success with health information exchange with the exception of targeted solutions in localized settings or alternatively, national systems focused on very limited 
                    data sets in specific program areas. For any collaborating healthcare organizations, sharing patient data has many challenges, one of which is that these organizations each employ technology-based 
                    systems with differing capabilities for data exchange. Often times, meeting the technical requirements of any data exchange project is overwhelming and in many cases, technical requirements of one 
                    initiative conflicts with the technical requirements of another. Conflicting code sets, message types, document types and transport methods confuse and potentially overwhelm technical staffs When 
                    will a solution be available that eases the burden for healthcare providers to more easily share patient data?
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>Health-e-link's Universal HIE Solution</h4>
                <p>
                    The Health-e-Link Universal HIE solution is the one "flexible" health information exchange network that allows healthcare partners in your community to share patient information even when their 
                    technology-based systems are incompatible. The Universal HIE allows you to define individual partnerships on the network and the technical specifications that support data exchange for each partnership. 
                    The Universal HIE specifies who can share data with whom, which transport methods are supported, which document and message types are supported, which code sets are used within the supported message types, 
                    and finally, the processing rules associated with each data exchange configuration. Health-e-link's Universal HIE uses these configurable features to ensure that each customer's unique data exchange 
                    requirements are fully addressed. Health-e-link's Universal HIE serves as the single point of integration with all data exchange partners in your healthcare delivery network.

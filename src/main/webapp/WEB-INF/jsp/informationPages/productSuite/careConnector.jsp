                <h4>Evolving Collaborative Healthcare Landscape</h4>
                <p>
                    Healthcare providers, their community-based partners, and public health agencies are looking for innovative opportunities to 
                    help meet triple aim goals of better population health, better experience of care and lower costs. Today, there are evolving 
                    new models of care with non-traditional healthcare providers that address the specific needs of patients outside of their primary 
                    care settings. The challenge however is developing effective communications channels between healthcare providers and their collaborating partners. 
                    Today, these communications channels are nothing more than word of mouth or at best, paper-based fax communications. With evolving EMR/EHR and HIE capabilities 
                    across the nation's healthcare system, there must be a better way!
                </p>
                <br />

                <p>
                    Government sponsored health agencies are recognizing and pursuing opportunities for improving the quality and accuracy of patient data they collect for healthcare oversight activities. 
                    While annual aggregate patient data reporting from affiliated healthcare agencies was an acceptable standard just a few years ago, recent advances in health data exchange suggest that 
                    visit-based patient data collection, analysis, and reporting is a realistic goal. Health-e-Link helps to achieve this goal and:

                <p>
                    Community healthcare providers are faced with HIT resourcing challenges. Internal staffing and budgetary restrictions limit your ability to keep pace with advances in data sharing and

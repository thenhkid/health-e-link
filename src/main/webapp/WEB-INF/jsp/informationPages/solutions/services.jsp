                <h4>Support Services</h4>
                <p>
                    Health-e-link staff collaborates with our customers to understand partnerships within your network of care, the level of maturity of your collaborative business models, your vision for integrated care 
                    models and your current and planned utilization of technology. Working with you, we use this information to develop strategies for implementing transformative care delivery and program management models 
                    enabled by our technology solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At Health-e-link, we work closely with our clients, large and small, because we realize the significant impact that healthcare information integration can have on resource utilization, clinical workflow, 
                    and health outcomes. Our support services and associated project management processes are designed to foster community collaboration and to help all stakeholders - patients, healthcare providers, 
                    community-based organizations and public health agencies achieve their goals. Using the <a href="<c:url value='/#productSuite'/>" title="Product Suite Overview">Health-e-Link Suite of interoperability solutions</a> as the foundation, Health-e-link staff works with you before, 
                    during and after implementation to ensure that your goals and objectives are met. 
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>Planning</h4>
                <p>
                    Prior to implementation, the Health-e-Link Team will meet with key leaders across your collaborating partnerships in order to understand your priorities for data exchange and data management. We review the 
                    collaborative organizational structure as well as existing and planned data exchange and data management practices. We then propose how our solutions can help transform your network of collaborating 
                    partners into a highly effective care delivery network with improved data sharing, data management, data analysis and reporting capabilities across your programs of care. Our staff uses an iterative 
                    consulting approach throughout the engagement to ensure that we understand your priorities, that we configure our system to meet your specific needs, and that your team understands and embraces the system 
                    to be implemented. Key planning steps include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Business Review</strong> - We work with you to understand your community of care, your collaborating partners and healthcare challenges you hope to address. </li>
                    <li><strong>Coalition Building</strong> - We'll help you to understand the challenges of data sharing across your coalition and ensure that you address issues to ensure productive and sustainable partnerships.</li>
                    <li><strong>Technical Infrastructure Review</strong> - We understand the interoperability features of your clinical systems. Health-e-link will work with your in house and vendor IT staffs to configure the interfaces to connect you to the Health-e-link network.  </li>
                    <li><strong>Formalize Network Requirements</strong> - Health-e-link provides preliminary test configurations of our solution for online review, and provides mockups for any custom features that may be required. Ultimately, you'll see your network in action before we begin installation and configuration. </li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                <h4>Installation and Configuration</h4>
                <p>
                    Whether using our hosted solution or licensing our software for installation, configuration and management within your own facilities, Health-e-link staff will ensure that the system, and your staffs, 
                    are prepared to meet your ongoing data management needs across your network of care. Due to our solution's highly flexible and configurable features, installation and configuration is greatly 
                    accelerated and is adaptable over time. With Heath-e-link, your network of care isn't bound by the constraints of typical interoperability solutions. As your network evolves, so will Health-e-link.
                    Key steps in our network configuration process include:
                </p>
                 <ul>
                    <li><strong>Install Health-e-link Suite</strong> - Installation and initial configuration of Health-e-link will be performed by our staff in collaboration with your IT staff.

                </ul>
                <br />
                <h4>Implementation</h4>
                <p>
                    At Health-e-link, we understand that integrated care and collaborative business models enabled by our technology solutions potentially represent significant changes to how patient care is provided and how healthcare professionals do their jobs. We also understand that existing 
                    business and clinical practices are often developed around legacy technology-based systems and established business practices with your partners. Guided by these perspectives, Health-e-link will implement our solutions with you in a way that aligns with your priorities and capabilities. 
                    We will work with you to ensure that your clinical and technical staffs are fully trained. We will implement Health-e-link in a phased approach to ensure that your staffs aren't overwhelmed with new responsibilities. After evaluating system performance on a periodic basis, we'll evolve network capabilities 
                    to ensure that Health-e-link continues to meet your expectations. Key phases to the implementation of Health-e-link include:        
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Train staff</strong> - We will train partner staffs on all facets of Health-e-link operation from data submission, to system operation, to data analysis and reporting.

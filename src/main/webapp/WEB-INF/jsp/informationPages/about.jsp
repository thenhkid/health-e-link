                <h4>Advancing Community-based Healthcare</h4>
                <p>
                    With a foundation in community-based healthcare and public health programs, Health-e-link was established to provide cost-effective solutions for managing healthcare information for community-based 
                    organizations and public health agencies. Historically, Health-e-link has focused specifically on helping our clients meet the data management needs of federal and state funded healthcare programs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Health-e-link's leadership understands that the widespread adoption of health information technology including electronic medical record systems and health information exchange networks are creating 
                    new opportunities for sharing information and improving the nation's healthcare system through technology. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, Health-e-link's leadership also understands that the highly complex standards being promoted by the Nation-wide Health Information Network (NwHIN) strategy often impose constraints that limit 
                    or even prevent data exchange in many networks of care. By providing a standards-based, but highly flexible health information exchange and data management solutions, Health-e-link positions healthcare providers, 
                    community-based organizations, and public health agencies to take advantage of new patient care models in their networks of care.
                </p>
                <br />
